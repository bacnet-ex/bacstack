defmodule BACnet.Protocol.FaultAlgorithms.FaultExtended do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents the BACnet fault algorithm `FaultExtended`.

  The FAULT_EXTENDED fault algorithm detects fault conditions based on a
  proprietary fault algorithm. The proprietary fault algorithm uses parameters
  and conditions defined by the vendor. The algorithm is identified by a
  vendor-specific fault type that is in the scope of the vendor's
  vendor identification code. The algorithm may, at the vendor's discretion,
  indicate a new reliability, a transition to the same reliability, or
  no transition to the reliability-evaluation process.

  For more specific information about the fault algorithm, consult ASHRAE 135 13.4.3.

  This module has NO implementation.
