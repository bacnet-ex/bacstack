  @moduledoc """
  BACnet has various different types of fault algorithms.
  Each of them is implemented by a different module.

  ASHRAE 135:
  > Certain object types may optionally support a fault algorithm which has
  > externally visible inputs and is performed as part of the object's
  > reliability-evaluation process. This clause defines the standard fault algorithms.
  > To determine which algorithm is applied by which object type, see the
  > object type definitions in Clause 12.
  >
  > Fault algorithms monitor a value and evaluate whether the condition for
  transition of reliability exists. The result of the evaluation,
  > indicated to the reliability-evaluation process, may be a transition
  > to a new reliability, a transition to the same reliability, or no transition.
  > The final determination of the Reliability property value is the responsibility
  > of the reliability evaluation process and is subject to additional conditions.
  > See Clause 13.2.
  > Each of the fault algorithms defines its input parameters, the allowable
  > reliability values, and the conditions for transitions between those values.
  > When evaluating the monitored value, all conditions defined for the algorithm
  > shall be evaluated in the order as presented for the algorithm.
  > Some algorithms specify optional conditions, marked as "Optional:" whether
  > or not an implementation uses these conditions is a local matter.
  > If no condition evaluates to true, then no transition shall be indicated
  > to the reliability evaluation process.
