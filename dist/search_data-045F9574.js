You can also use `:via` tuple for\nan alternative to locally registered names (or simply no registration at all).\nHowever since we need to \"link\" the processes, names make it a lot easier.\nThough the transport module does allow to use a function or MFA callback instead,\nso \"linking\" can be implementation by the user as desired.\n\nWe use the IPv4 transport and it will automatically determine a network interface to use.\nYou can also specify the network interface directly, if you want to or the wrong interface is selected.\nRefer to the documentation for more information.\n\n```elixir\nalias BACnet.Stack.Client\nalias BACnet.Stack.Segmentator\nalias BACnet.Stack.SegmentsStore\nalias BACnet.Stack.Transport.IPv4Transport\n\nIPv4Transport.open(Client, name: IPv4Transport)\nSegmentator.start_link(name: Segmentator)\nSegmentsStore.start_link(name: SegmentsStore)\nClient.start_link(\n  name: Client,\n  segmentator: Segmentator,\n  segments_store: SegmentsStore,\n  transport: IPv4Transport\n)\n```\n\nIn a more production environment these processes should be started under a supervisor\nand also where possible, you should specify the supervisor for the modules to use (i.e. IPv4 transport).\n\nYou can now use the `Client` module to interact with the BACnet network (i.e. send Who-Is messages).\nYou can also receive BACnet traffic by specifying a notification receiver when starting `Client`.\n\nSee also the `ClientHelper` module for functions orientated around helping you to send BACnet service requests.\n\nIf you need to interact with a remote BACnet network, you may want to register yourself as a Foreign Device.\nFor that case, you can start an additional process `ForeignDevice` and specify the BBMD.\nPlease note that the `Client` needs to be started on the correct network interface where the BBMD is reachable.\n\n```elixir\nalias BACnet.Stack.ForeignDevice\n\nForeignDevice.start_link(bbmd: {bbmd_ip, 0xBAC0}, client: Client)\n```","ref":"BACnet.html#module-getting-started"},{"type":"module","title":"Character Sets - BACnet","doc":"This library uses the library [Codepagex](https://hex.pm/packages/codepagex) to implement character set conversion.\nBy default, Codepagex only generates conversion code for fast conversion algorithms to and from UTF-8 (such as ISO-8859-1).\n\nIf you need to use other character sets, such as CP932 (JIS-X-0208) or CP850 (DBCS), you will have to configure  Codepagex accordingly.\nRefer to their documentation for the necessary steps.","ref":"BACnet.html#module-character-sets"},{"type":"module","title":"Time Zone - BACnet","doc":"When using this library, there are some functions that take or return `DateTime` structs.\nInside the library, there is a default timezone that will be used, when you don't particularily set/override the timezone.\nThe default timezone is an application environment configuration that is used across the library and can be used\nto set a different timezone than the default `Etc/UTC`.

Due to (single) precision issues, some floats will be rounded to the nearest single precision\nfloating point number representation, such as `0.3` -> `0.3000000004` or `6.9` -> `6.900000095367432`.\nBy default, if more than 3 consecutive numbers are the same, the float will be truncated to the first non-repeating,\nsuch as `6.914000045` -> `6.914`.\nThis behaviour can be configured at compile-time using the application environment `:bacstack`.\nSet `:app_tags_truncate_float32` to `false` to disable this behaviour entirely. To configure the precision (or minimum\nnumber of consecutive repeating numbers), configure `:app_tags_truncate_float32_precision` (defaults to `4`).\nIEEE 754 double precision floating point numbers (64bit floats) are entirely unaffected by this behaviour.\n\n> #### Information {: .info}\n>\n> The following information is quite low-level and is only intended for reference. Knowledge of the BACnet protocol is\n> required to use this module. Dealing with application tags is not required when using abstractions on top of\n> of the APDU layer, such as most of the `Services.*` modules.\n\nBACnet tags are encoded in an initial byte and zero or more conditional subsequent bytes. The initial byte is defined as\nfollows:\n```\nBit Number:\n    7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0\n|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n|       Tag Number       |Class|Length/Value/Type|\n|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n```\nwhere Tag Number = the tag number within the class\n\nClass = the class of tag (application or context specific)\n\nLength/Value/Type = whether the data following the tag is primitive or constructed and specifies the length\nor value of primitive data.\n\nTag numbers ranging from 0 to 14 are encoded in the initial byte. Tag numbers from 15 to 254 (255 is reserved by ASHRAE) are encoded\nby setting the tag number bits to `0b1111` and the tag number extension byte in the subsequent byte to the initial byte denotes the actual tag number.\n\nThe Length/Value/Type bits are used to distinguish between primitive and constructed data. The Length/Value/Type bits are defined as follows:\n  - if the application tag denotes a boolean, then the boolean value is encoded in the Length/Value/Type bits\n  - if the data is primitive and not constructed, the Length/Value/Type bits denote the length, length from 0-4 are encoded in those bits, for\n    length from 5 to 253 the bits are set to `0b101` and the subsequent byte denotes the length from 0-253, for\n    length from 254 to 65535 the bits are set to `0b101`, the subsequent byte is set to 254 and the following two bytes denotes the length from 0-65535, for\n    length from 65536 to 2^32-1 the bits are set to `0b101`, the subsequent byte is set to 255 and the following four bytes denotes the length from 0-2^32-1\n  - if the data is constructed, the Length/Value/Type bits are set to `0b110` to declare an opening tag, the tags follow in complete application tags encoding,\n    and the closing tag is encoded with the same tag number and class as the opening tag and the Length/Value/Type bits are set to `0b111` to declare a closing tag\n\nConstructed data contains zero or more tagged elements. Each tagged element may be a constructed element iself, this does not result in ambiguous encoding.\n\nThe following table shows application tags:\n\n| Tag Number | Datatype           | Respective Elixir decoding (unwrapped)                   |\n|------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0          | Null               | `nil`                                                    |\n| 1          | Boolean            | `boolean()`                                              |\n| 2          | Unsigned Integer   | `non_neg_integer()`                                      |\n| 3          | Signed Integer     | `integer()`                                              |\n| 4          | Real               | `float()`                                                |\n| 5          | Double             | `float()`                                                |\n| 6          | Octet String       | `binary()`                                               |\n| 7          | Character String   | `String.t()`                                             |\n| 8          | Bitstring          | `tuple()`, each element is a `boolean()` (left to right) |\n| 9          | Enumerated         | `non_neg_integer()`                                      |\n| 10         | Date               | `BACnetDate.t()`                                         |\n| 11         | Time               | `BACnetTime.t()`                                         |\n| 12         | Object Identifier  | `ObjectIdentifier.t()`                                   |\n| 13-15      | Reserved by ASHRAE |                                                          |\n\nFor common application tags, you will receive decoding results such as:\n```elixir\n{:enumerated, 3}\n{:object_identifier, %ObjectIdentifier{\n  instance: 111,\n  type: :device\n}}\n{:unsigned_integer, 50}\n```\n\nContext-specific tags contain context-specific data, which are not denoted directly by an application tag.\nAs such the data cannot be directly decoded to the correct datatype, but the application must direct the datatype to correctly decode the data.\nAs such the following result is not uncommon:\n```elixir\n{:tagged, {1, <<2, 15, 226, 104>>, 4}}\n```\n\nThe `:tagged` atom denotes a context-specific tag encoding and contains the bytes that were given along with the tag encoding (in this case 4 bytes).\nHowever due to the context and the correct datatype being unknown, the bytes couldn't be directly decoded to a particular datatype.\n\nConstructed data may contain primitive or context-specific tags, as such both results are to be expected:\n```elixir\n{:constructed, {1, {:octet_string, <<11, 22>>}, 0}}\n{:constructed, {3, {:tagged, {0, <<2, 12, 49, 0>>, 4}}, 0}}\n```\n\nOr even nested constructed data:\n```elixir\n{:constructed, {12,\n     {:constructed, {6,\n       [\n         tagged: {0, \"U\", 1},\n         constructed: {2, {:real, 1.0}, 0}\n       ], 0}}, 0}}\n```\n\nThe above snippet contains a tagged and constructed element. The tagged contains a binary with length 1 and the constructed contains a real with value 1.0.\nIn case of the constructed element, the value was decoded, as the datatype is known. In case of the tagged element, the datatype is unknown and as such\nknowledge of the BACnet protocol and the context the element is from needs to be known.\n\nIf that is known, the function `unfold_to_type/2` can be used to produce a primitive value by specifying the correct datatype as an atom.\n```elixir\nApplicationTags.unfold_to_type(:unsigned_integer, {:tagged, {0, \"U\", 1}})\n```\n\nConstructed data can also be a list of values, for example when dealing with Priority Arrays:\n```elixir\n{:constructed, {3,\n  [\n      null: nil,\n      null: nil,\n      null: nil,\n

objective of the arbitration process is to ensure the desired behavior of an object\nthat is manipulated by several program (or non-program) entities.\nFor example, a start/stop program may specify that a particular Binary Output should be ON,\nwhile demand metering may specify that the same Binary Output should be OFF.\nIn this case, the OFF should take precedence. An operator may be able to override\nthe demand metering program and force the Binary Output ON, in which case the ON should take precedence.\n\nIn BACnet, this arbitration is provided by a prioritization scheme that assigns varying levels\nof priorities to commanding entities on a system-wide basis. Each object that contains a commandable property\nis responsible for acting upon prioritized commands in the order of their priorities.\nWhile there is a trade-off between the complexity and the robustness of any such mechanism,\nthe scheme described here is intended to be effective but applicable to even simple BACnet devices.","ref":"BACnet.Protocol.PriorityArray.html#module-command-prioritization"},{"type":"module","title":"Prioritization Mechanism - BACnet.Protocol.PriorityArray","doc":"For BACnet objects, commands are prioritized based upon a fixed number of priorities\nthat are assigned to command-issuing entities.\nA prioritized command (one that is directed at a commandable property of an object) is performed\nvia a WriteProperty service request or a WritePropertyMultiple service request.\nThe request primitive includes a conditional 'Priority' parameter that ranges from 1 to 16.\nEach commandable property of an object has an associated priority table\nthat is represented by a `priority_array` property.\nThe PriorityArray consists of an array of commanded values in order of decreasing priority.\nThe first value in the array corresponds to priority 1 (highest),\nthe second value corresponds to priority 2, and so on,\nto the sixteenth value that corresponds to priority 16 (lowest).\n\nAn entry in the PriorityArray may have a commanded value or a NULL.\nA NULL value indicates that there is no existing command at that priority.\nAn object continuously monitors all entries within the priority table in order\nto locate the entry with the highest priority non-NULL value and\nsets the commandable property to this value.\n\nA commanding entity (application program, operator, etc.) may issue a command\nto write to the commandable property of an object,\nor it may relinquish a command issued earlier.

Its In_Process property is FALSE, indicating\nthat the Command object is waiting for its Present_Value property to be written with a value.\nWhen Present_Value is written, the Command object shall begin a sequence of actions.\nThe In_Process property shall be set to TRUE, indicating that the Command object has begun\nprocessing one of a set of action sequences that is selected based on the particular value\nwritten to the Present_Value property. If an attempt is made to write to the Present_Value\nproperty through WriteProperty services while In_Process is TRUE, then a Result(-) shall be\nreturned with 'error class' = OBJECT and 'error code' = BUSY, rejecting the write.\n\nThe new value of the Present_Value property determines which sequence of actions the Command\nobject shall take. These actions are specified in an array of action lists indexed by this value.\nThe Action property contains these lists. A given list may be empty, in which case no action\ntakes place, except that In_Process is returned to FALSE and All_Writes_Successful is set to TRUE.\nIf the list is not empty, then for each action in the list the Command object shall write a\nparticular value to a particular property of a particular object in a particular BACnet Device.\nNote, however, that the capability to write to remote devices is not required.\nNote also that the Command object does not guarantee that every write will be successful,\nand no attempt is made by the Command object to \"roll back\" successfully written properties\nto their previous values in the event that one or more writes fail. If any of the writes fail,\nthen the All_Writes_Successful property is set to FALSE and the Write_Successful flag for that\nBACnetActionCommand is set to FALSE. If the Quit_On_Failure flag is TRUE for the failed\nBACnetActionCommand, then all subsequent BACnetActionCommands in the list shall have their\nWrite_Successful flag set to FALSE. If an individual write succeeds, then the Write_Successful flag\nfor that BACnetActionCommand shall be set to TRUE. If all the writes are successful,\nthen the All_Writes_Successful property is set to TRUE. Once all the writes have been processed\nto completion by the Command object, the In_Process property is set back to FALSE and the\nCommand object becomes passive again, waiting for another command.\n\nIt is important to note that the particular value that is written to the Present_Value property\nis not what triggers the action, but the act of writing itself. Thus if the Present_Value property\nhas the value 5 and it is again written with the value 5, then the 5th list of actions will be\nperformed again. Writing zero to the Present_Value causes no action to be taken and is the same as\ninvoking an empty list of actions. The Command object is a powerful concept with many beneficial applications.\nHowever, there are unique aspects of the Command object that can cause confusing or destructive side effects\nif the Command object is improperly configured. Since the Command object can manipulate other\nobjects' properties, it is possible that a Command object could be configured to command itself.\nIn such a case, the In_Process property acts as an interlock and protects the Command object\nfrom selfoscillation.\nHowever, it is also possible for a Command object to command another Command object that commands the first\nCommand object and so on. The possibility exists for Command objects that command GROUP objects.\nIn these cases of \"circular referencing,\" it is possible for confusing side effects to occur.\nWhen references occur to objects in other BACnet Devices, there is an increased possibility of time delays,\nwhich could cause oscillatory behavior between Command objects that are improperly configured\nin such a circular manner. Caution should be exercised when configuring Command objects\nthat reference objects outside the BACnet device that contains them.\n\n(ASHRAE 135 - Clause 12.10)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe following part has been automatically generated.\n\n \n Click to expand \n\nThis module defines a BACnet object of the type `command`.

The buffer may be cleared by writing a zero to\nthe Record_Count property. The determination of which notifications are\nplaced into the log is a local matter. Each record in the buffer has an\nimplied SequenceNumber that is equal to the value of the Total_Record_Count\nproperty immediately after the record is added.\n\nLogging may be enabled and disabled through the Enable property and\nat dates and times specified by the Start_Time and Stop_Time properties.\nEvent Log enabling and disabling is recorded in the event log buffer.\nEvent reporting (notification) may be provided to facilitate automatic\nfetching of event log records by processes on other devices such as fileservers.\nSupport is provided for algorithmic reporting; optionally, intrinsic reporting may be provided.\nEvent Log objects that support intrinsic reporting shall apply the BUFFER_READY event algorithm.\n\nIn intrinsic reporting, when the number of records specified by\nthe Notification_Threshold property has been collected since the previous\nnotification (or startup), a new notification is sent to all subscribed devices.\nIn response to a notification, subscribers may fetch all of the new records.\nIf a subscriber needs to fetch all of the new records, it should use\nthe 'By Sequence Number' form of the ReadRange service request.\nA missed notification may be detected by a subscriber if the 'Current Notification'\nparameter received in the previous BUFFER_READY notification is different than\nthe 'Previous Notification' parameter of the current BUFFER_READY notification.\nIf the ReadRange-ACK response to the ReadRange request issued under these conditions\nhas the FIRST_ITEM bit of the 'Result Flags' parameter set to TRUE, event log records\nhave probably been missed by this subscriber. The acquisition of log records by\nremote devices has no effect upon the state of the Event Log object itself.\nThis allows completely independent, but properly sequential, access to its log records\nby all remote devices. Any remote device can independently update its records at any time.\n\n(ASHRAE 135 - Clause 12.27)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe following part has been automatically generated.\n\n \n Click to expand \n\nThis module defines a BACnet object of the type `event_log`.

Notification Classes are useful for event-initiating objects\nthat have identical needs in terms of how their notifications should be handled,\nwhat the destination(s) for their notifications should be, and how they should\nbe acknowledged. A notification class defines how event notifications shall be\nprioritized in their handling according to TO_OFFNORMAL, TO_FAULT, and TO_NORMAL events;\nwhether these categories of events require acknowledgment (nearly always by a\nhuman operator); and what destination devices or processes should receive notifications.\n\nThe purpose of prioritization is to provide a means to ensure that alarms or event\nnotifications with critical time considerations are not unnecessarily delayed.\nThe possible range of priorities is 0 - 255. A lower number indicates a higher priority.\nThe priority and the Network Priority (Clause 6.2.2) are associated as defined in Table 13-5.\n\nPriorities may be assigned to TO_OFFNORMAL, TO_FAULT, and TO_NORMAL events\nindividually within a notification class. The purpose of acknowledgment is to\nprovide assurance that a notification has been acted upon by some other agent,\nrather than simply having been received correctly by another device.\nIn most cases, acknowledgments come from human operators.\nTO_OFFNORMAL, TO_FAULT, and TO_NORMAL events may, or may not, require individual\nacknowledgment within a notification class.\nIt is often necessary for event notifications to be sent to multiple destinations or\nto different destinations based on the time of day or day of week.\n\nNotification Classes may specify a list of destinations, each of which is qualified by time\nday of week, and type of handling. A destination specifies a set of days of the week\n(Monday through Sunday) during which the destination is considered viable by\nthe Notification Class object. In addition, each destination has a FromTime and ToTime,\nwhich specify a window using specific times, on those days of the week,\nduring which the destination is viable. If an event that uses a Notification Class object\noccurs and the day is one of the days of the week that is valid for a given destination and\nthe time is within the window specified in the destination, then the destination shall be\nsent a notification. Destinations may be further qualified, as applicable, by any combination\nof the three event transitions TO_OFFNORMAL, TO_FAULT, or TO_NORMAL.\nThe destination also defines the recipient device to receive the notification and a process\nwithin the device. Processes are identified by numeric handles that are only meaningful to\nthe destination device. The administration of these handles is a local matter.\nThe recipient device may be specified by either its unique Device Object_Identifier\nor its BACnetAddress. In the latter case, a specific node address, a multicast address,\nor a broadcast address may be used. The destination further specifies whether the notification\nshall be sent using a confirmed or unconfirmed event notification.\n\n(ASHRAE 135 - Clause 12.21)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe following part has been automatically generated.\n\n \n Click to expand \n\nThis module defines a BACnet object of the type `notification_class`.

Details of this calculation are provided in the description of the Present_Value property.\n\nVersions of the Schedule object prior to Protocol_Revision 4 only support schedules that define\nan entire day, from midnight to midnight. For compatibility with these versions, this whole day\nbehavior can be achieved by using a specific schedule format.\nWeekly_Schedule and Exception_Schedule values that begin at 00:00, and do not use any NULL values,\nwill define schedules for the entire day.

The PID is of the `Client` process.\nFor the rest, see `t:BACnet.Stack.TransportBehaviour.transport_msg/0`.\n\nBACnet APDUs are decoded, checked against the internal cache and forwarded to the application.\nThe client has an internal cache for requests for the application and replies from the application\nto the transport protocol in order to deduplicate request (i.e. when the application takes for the\nremote BACnet device far too long and re-sends the APDU).\nIn case of duplicated request, the request will not be forwarded to the application,\ninstead it will be silently dropped and the application will possibly reply in a timely fashion,\nor the APDU timeout will occur and the Client will reply instead - this situation may arise when\nthe response does not arrive at the remote BACnet device within\nthe remote BACnet device's configured APDU timeout window.\nIndividual APDU timeouts on a per-source basis can be applied using `set_apdu_timeouts/2`.\n\nThe client will also keep track of sent APDUs for confirmed service requests and re-send them\nautomatically, if no response arrives in the APDU timeout timeframe.

As per BACnet standard\nthere's no defined mechanism how it gets decided which events go to which\nevent log, the only way to do event logging is by explicitely triggering\nevent logging with `trigger_log/3`.\n\nTrend logging can occur in three different modes as per BACnet standard:\n- `:triggered` - Logging has to be manually triggered through BACnet.\n- `:polled` - Logging is done periodically and for each poll, the object is read.\n- `:cov` - Logging is done through COV reporting.\n\nFor COV reporting, COV subscription will only occur on remote object, when `cov_cb`\nis in the `opts` of `start_link/1` and if `cov_resubscription_interval` on\nthe object is present and not zero.\nCOV subscription does not mean the COV notifications get automatically routed\nto this module (however they can, if the given `cov_cb` callback does the routing).\nThe COV callback must use confirmed COV subscriptions, as per BACnet standard.\n\nFor COV reporting on the local device, the user has to route COV notifications\nto this module manually and invoke the `notify/2` function.\n\nPlease note that clock-aligned logging is currently not supported by this module.\n\nWhenever the buffer reaches its max size, a notification can be sent to the\nspecified notification receiver (an atom (registered name) or PID). Additionally,\nfor Intrinsic Reporting-enabled objects, intrinsic reporting will occur and\nprovide notifications once the algorithm `BUFFER_READY` triggers.\n\nEvents occur as messages: `{:bacnet_trend_logger, nil, object(), metadata}`\n\nThe object received is not updated when updates happen in BACnet or otherwise\nin the application. The only changes are when using `change_log_state/3` or\nwhen logging gets stopped due to `stop_when_full: true` (buffer is full),\nthus the object is otherwise in the same state as when it was added or updated.\n\n`metadata` is a map of:\n- `buffer: {module(), LogBufferBehaviour.t()}`\n- `event: :buffer_full | :intrinsic_reporting`\n- `intrinsic: NotificationParameters.BufferReady.t() | nil`\n\nTo trigger `time_change` log data in the log buffer, these need to be manually\ntriggered by the user. There's no clock time tracking in this module.\nTheoretically this can be implemented by monitoring time offsets using\n`:erlang.monitor(:time_offset, :clock_service)` and process those message.\nUpon processing these messages, one can trigger `time_change` using `trigger_log/3`.","ref":"BACnet.Stack.TrendLogger.html"},{"type":"type","title":"BACnet.Stack.TrendLogger.object/0","doc":"Represents valid BACnet objects.
